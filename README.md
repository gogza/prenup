# Nuptials

## A project planning tool that allows you to meaningfully engage your clients and convert their domain knowledge into tangible milestones, features, scenarions, and unit tests.

## Features

- Scenarios are created using Kyuri, a custom dialect of Gherkin geared towards asyncrounsous programming
- Heavily influenced by Cucumber. If you know Cuke, you know Nuptials.
- Generates VowsJS testing stubs (VowsJS is a well established node.js testing framework)


### Features and Scenarios
